        <h1>About the region of Marapaich</h1>

        <p>This region is based on the Olympic games, where trainers and pokemon can come to enter the O.L.Y.M.P.U.S games to see who is the best Pokemon Trainer. Trainers from every region come here every four years to compete in the games, however they can only use Pokemon that are found in the region. This means that trainers come over a month before the event and build a team on the island soley using Pokemon native to the region to avoid any advantages a trainer may have over the competition, but also to avoid damage to the precious ecosystem found on Marapaich</p>
